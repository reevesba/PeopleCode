# Send Emails with Attachments using PeopleCode

### General Attachments
Sends an attachment hosted on the application server to user via email.

### BI Publisher Reports
Generates a BI Publisher report then sends it to user via email.

**Note:** the methods presented here use the SendMail function. This function is deprecated and it's recommended to use the MCFOutboundEmail class instead. The setup and execution is very similiar to SendMail and there is plenty of documentation online.
